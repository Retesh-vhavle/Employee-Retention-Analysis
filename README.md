The dashboards I created provide an in-depth analysis of key employee trends and performance metrics within the organization. One of the primary focus areas is the average attrition rate across all departments, which helps to identify where employee turnover is most prevalent and where retention strategies may need to be strengthened. In addition to this, I analyzed the average hourly rate of male research scientists, offering valuable insights into compensation patterns, particularly in this role.

The relationship between attrition rate and monthly income is also a critical aspect of this analysis, shedding light on the income brackets where employees are more likely to leave, thus highlighting areas where compensation adjustments might improve retention. Another important metric is the average working years for each department, which offers a clear view of employee tenure and experience within different teams.

Further, the analysis explores job role versus work-life balance, providing a detailed look at how employees across various roles perceive their work-life integration, which is crucial for improving overall satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, I examined the correlation between attrition rate and the years since an employee's last promotion, offering valuable insights into how promotion timelines influence turnover rates and employee dissatisfaction.

Supporting metrics, such as departmental income comparisons, job satisfaction by marital status, and performance ratings across different years, enhance the overall understanding of employee dynamics and provide a broader context for decision-making.
